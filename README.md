# Federated Membership Inference on Federboost
This package implements 'Federboost' from Tian *et al* 
Which is a horizontally federated Gradient Boosted Decision Tree algorithm. With the regularisation terms of **XGBoost**. This is not a 1 to 1 conversion from XGBoost to python, the models perform remarkebly close when regularisation parameters are used, but they differ more when it is not used. 

This is a multi-class classification implementation that uses softmax. Also different types of Membership Inference Attack can be tested, both using federated information or without.

Paper will be available here on 13 December 2023.

TODO: 

- Clear up for other researchers
   * code cleanup & explination
- Change naming from old SFXGBoost to FXGBoost

Usage:
install conda environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Activate your environment:
```
conda activate fedxgboost_mpi
```

build and run the experiments using:
```
pip install . && mpiexec -np 3 python tests/main.py (experiment number 1 to 3)
```
here ```-np 3``` implies 1 server and two participants in the federated network.
for this you will have to change the ```POSSIBLE_PATHS``` parameter for the healthcare dataset.

or use "run.sh":
```
./run.sh myexperimentname (experiment number 1 to 3)
```
