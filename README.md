# Federated Membership Inference on Federboost
This confusing package name actually implements Federboost from Tian *et al*.
Which is a horizontally federated Gradient Boosted Decision Tree algorithm. With the regularisation terms of **XGBoost**. 

This is a multi-class classification implementation that uses softmax

Paper will be available here in December 2023 or a bit later.

TODO: 

- Clear up for other researchers
   * remove all useless output files
   * remove useless images
   * remove useless code
- Release paper
- finish experiment1, experiment2 code
- Change naming from old SFXGBoost to FXGBoost
